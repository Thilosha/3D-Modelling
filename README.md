# 3D Modeling using Python for LiDAR Point Clouds

This repository contains Python code and resources for performing 3D modeling using LiDAR point clouds. The project aims to provide a comprehensive set of tools and examples for processing and visualizing LiDAR data, enabling users to generate accurate and detailed 3D models.

## Features

- Loading and processing LiDAR point cloud data in popular formats such as LAS and PLY.
- Preprocessing steps including filtering, outlier removal, and downsampling.
- Extraction of geometric features such as surface normals and curvature.
- Reconstruction of 3D models using techniques like triangulation and meshing.
- Visualization of point clouds and generated models using open-source libraries.
- Examples and tutorials demonstrating various modeling techniques and workflows.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/3d-modeling-lidar-python.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to set up your environment and configure the project.

## Usage

1. Import the necessary modules: `import lidar_processing, model_reconstruction, visualization`
2. Load the LiDAR point cloud data: `point_cloud = lidar_processing.load_point_cloud('data.las')`
3. Preprocess the data: `filtered_cloud = lidar_processing.filter_outliers(point_cloud)`
4. Extract features: `normals = lidar_processing.compute_normals(filtered_cloud)`
5. Perform model reconstruction: `mesh = model_reconstruction.triangulate(point_cloud, normals)`
6. Visualize the results: `visualization.plot_point_cloud(point_cloud)`

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, please refer to the [documentation](docs/README.md).
